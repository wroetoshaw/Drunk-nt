# Drunk-nt (DRIVESAFE)
 Android based application to detect Drunk Driver.
 
The app works by including the driver in some sort of activity (such as a quiz or a captcha) in order to track their hand motions and determine their level of intoxication.

If the driver is confirmed to be inebriated, disable the engine via Low Energy Bluetooth connection between the phone application and the Engine Control Unit (ECU). (Conceptual)

Access to Google Maps, SOS (emergency messaging), Cloud Storage for vehicle papers, and Vehicle Analytics are all available.
